Dear Madam/Sir,

\vspace{10 mm}
Please consider our manuscript, entitled "Robust Semi-supervised Least Squares Classification by Implicit Constraints", for publication as a full length article.  The article is a completely revised, corrected, and extended version of an earlier symposium contribution at the 14th International Symposium on Advances in Intelligent Data Analysis which has been published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science in 2015. As mentioned in the manuscript we extend the work by showing the proposed procedure can be formulated  as a quadratic programming problem, we extend the experimental results section by including an alternative semi-supervised procedure, adding additional datasets and discussing the ‘peaking’ phenomenon. Moreover, we extend the theoretical results with conditions when one is likely to see improvement of the proposed approach over the supervised classifier.
